## Proposal

> This is the bulk of the RFC.

> Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with Powertools for AWS Lambda (Java) to understand it, and for somebody familiar with the implementation to implement it.

## Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

> Why should we *not* do this?

> Do we need additional dependencies? Impact performance/package size?
